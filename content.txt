1. Class and Object (Example)

class has data/attributes and method/function.
class attributes called itself but method called manually.
why python is called OOPs: because everything in python is an object(data structure, data type etc.)

Advantage of OOPs:
> You can create your own datatypes.
> code resuability
> debugging
> easy to colab.

End to end Proejct(Chatter)
> Encapsulation
> Getter and setter
> Static method
